# hello-world

Hi There!

I am here to gain knowledge of the every growing field of coding and software maintenance. Currently reside in New York working for a media sales company in midtown NYC.  Really looking for tutorials and lessons in which someone that is a novice will be able to tackle.  I am open to all suggestions.

Thanks in advance!
